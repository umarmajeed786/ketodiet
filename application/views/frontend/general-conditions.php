                    <p>
                        17.1. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by the laws of Texas without regard to its
                        principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of Client’s location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        17.2. Informal Dispute Resolution. Client agrees to participate in informal dispute resolution
                        before filing a claim against the Company. Any complaints in relation to the Company and the
                        Services provided to the Client should be addressed to the Company by contacting
                        [email&#160;protected] Client should clearly indicate that a complaint is being submitted and
                        specify the grounds and circumstances concerning the complaint. The Company will send a
                        complaint acknowledgement to the e-mail address from which the complaint has been received. We
                        will consider the complaint and respond to the Client within 14 calendar days of the day of
                        receipt of a relevant complaint. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 calendar days of the day
                        of receipt of a relevant complaint, Client or Company may bring a formal claim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        17.3. Arbitration. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising
                        out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between Client and
                        Company, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal
                        theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator
                        instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Client and Company agrees that Client and Company are
                        each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes
                        arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision,
                        including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any
                        portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not
                        by a court or judge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        17.4. Client agrees that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual
                        basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and Client is agreeing to give up
                        the ability to participate in a class action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        17.5. Client may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by emailing [email&#160;protected] with
                        Client’s first name, last name, and address within thirty (30) days of accepting this agreement
                        to arbitrate, with a statement that Client declines this arbitration agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        17.6. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its
                        Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are
                        available online at https://www.adr.org/consumer. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any,
                        by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator
                        determines upon request by Client or Company that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any
                        in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties
                        with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the
                        parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by
                        the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be
                        final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent
                        injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to
                        the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator.
                        The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
                        jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will
                        preclude Client from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and,
                        if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.
                    </p>
